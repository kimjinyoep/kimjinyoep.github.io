      The tenth season of The Walking Dead, an American post-apocalyptic horror television series on AMC premiered on October 6, 2019, and will conclude on April 4, 2021, consisting of 22 episodes.[1] Developed for television by Frank Darabont, the series is based on the eponymous series of comic books by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard. The executive producers are Kirkman, David Alpert, Scott M. Gimple, Angela Kang, Greg Nicotero, Joseph Incaprera, Denise Huth, and Gale Anne Hurd, with Kang as showrunner for the second consecutive season.[2]

This season adapts material from issues #145â€“174 of the comic book series and focuses on the group's preparation and war against the Whisperers. Set several months after the massacre perpetrated by Alpha (Samantha Morton) during the community fair, the season focuses on the united communities as they initiate a fight in order to end the threat of the Whisperers.

The tenth season is the final season for series regular Danai Gurira, who has portrayed Michonne since the third season.[3][4] The planned season finale was scheduled to air on April 12, 2020, but post-production was delayed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, the episode aired on October 4, 2020, with an additional six episodes added to the tenth season to broadcast from February 28 to April 4, 2021</p>
